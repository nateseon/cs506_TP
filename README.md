Explainable AI for Loan Approval Prediction
Project Overview
This project focuses on developing an Explainable AI (XAI) system to predict loan approval outcomes based on a dataset containing various applicant features such as income, education, CIBIL score, loan amount, and more. The goal is to build a transparent and interpretable machine learning model that can assist financial institutions in making data-driven decisions about loan approvals.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features to ensure the data is ready for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between features like education, income, and CIBIL score with loan approval status to understand key trends and correlations.

Machine Learning Models: Using supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines) to predict loan approval. The project also explores unsupervised learning techniques like K-Means Clustering for further insights.

Model Evaluation: Implementing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves to assess model performance.

Explainability: The AI model is designed to provide transparent and interpretable predictions, helping users understand the factors influencing loan approval decisions.

Data
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains the following columns:

Income: Applicantâ€™s annual income.

Education: Education status (Graduate/Not Graduate).

CIBIL Score: Credit score to assess loan eligibility.

Loan Amount: The loan amount applied for.

Loan Status: Whether the loan was Approved or Rejected.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for data manipulation, model building, and evaluation.

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For building machine learning models, including preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Matplotlib / Seaborn: For data visualization and model performance visualization.

Jupyter Notebook: For step-by-step coding and documentation.
